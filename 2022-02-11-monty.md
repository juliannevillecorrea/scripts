It is said art imitates life but can the converse be true?
Well to a certain extent it is true, isn't it? 
Such is the story of Monty, an artisan. 
On a chilly winter's morning while the birds were twittering, the tree leaves rustling, the street dogs barking, the early morning newspaper men, the cart vendors preparing for the day ahead, Monty got out of bed. 
Now Monty was a seasoned craftsman he would work with paper cloth or wood.
In all his years there was never a job he had great difficulty at, that is to say he was a master of his chosen vocation.
He lived in a well lit 2 room house at day and at night 2 light bulbs provided him light. 
Monty was an early riser and a disciplined man. 
He took great care of his tools and raw materials. 
He didn't have frequent job  orders but enough to provide for himself, he was unmarried but married to his craft.
Of paper, cloth and wood he enjoyed working with wood the most.
Most of the orders Monty received were that of chairs.
Now it was second nature for him to construct chairs, especially rocking chairs.
People in the neighbourhood loved the dedication, finish, love and time Monty put into his work. 
Many would drop by just to see him engrossed in his work, one with his tools so much so they were appendages of his hands. 
One could also see the years of work in his hands the way they had been aged and seasoned so to speak. 
Monty never had any likeness towards food or entertainment; he was solely or mostly devoted his time to his work. 


The place where Monty lived was quite busy one would say but not overly crowded.
There were shopkeepers, merchants, a bazaar, repair shops just like one would find in a semi urban semi village hybrid of a town. 
There were also patrons of the arts and connoisseurs of food, especially sweets.  
As the seasons changed so did Monty’s clientele and as he was most adept at wood work he would get orders of furniture, toys, house fittings like windows and doors etc.

……………………………………
In his heart Monty secretly despised the chair even though most of his money came from making chairs. 
He was always thinking to himself am I not enslaving my sisters and my brothers for the chair is a thief of time and robs one of her or his will.
In my experience how many of my peers have ordered chairs built by me and then wasted away parking their bottoms on them. 
The chair has to be destroyed ! 
How does it hypnotise the living man to sit down and become almost lifeless. 
Just some pieces of wood and a sinister contraption. 
Entrapment of the soul

Monty was a man of excellence, one day he thought to him
