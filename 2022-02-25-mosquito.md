INT COURTROOM\
Int room makeshift futuristic court\ 
The film opens to a futuristic court where two parties are in heated debate.
The court room is barebones, minimalistic and utilitarian with two lawyers, virtual jury and virtual audience facing a judge.
In the middle there is a jar with mosquito larvae.
Both lawyers are taking turns arguing their case.

INT COURTROOM\
Camera brings into focus one lawyer.\
For: "My lord i stand before you today to plead the case of my client the humble (sounds of uproar in virtual audience watching on stream) (lawyer clears throat) mosquito".\
Judge: "Order, order. There will be order in my courthouse".\
(all the watching audience speak in hushed tones)\
(and jury members give varied expressions.)\
(the date on the calender reads 2200)\
(camera pans to the lawyer against)

Against:"We explicitly discourage adjectives my lord. Is it not convention"
(audience members nodding in approval)\
(shot of jury too)
For: "If you would only allow me my lord"\
Judge: "Point noted. The defense will refrain from adjectives citing the sensitivity of the case.The court cannot allow adjectives especially in this case"\
For: "Yes my lord"\
Judge: "proceed"\
For:" My lord my client is just just like all of us an organism, a life form, spawned by mother Earth herself and he does what he is compelled to to survive. With this simple opening statement i would earge the jury and judge to grant a birth aboard the ark to my client"
